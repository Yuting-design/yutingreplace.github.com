        <p>I would like to make a web page collection and showcase the user's special day. Users can choose and publish
            what that day means to them. Others can leave messages for him. I don't want any bad messages because it
            could create conflict. So I might look for an API to detect user input.
            Everyone seems to think my topic is good. The second version of the proposed change is shown above. I find
            that people who associate emotions with colors don't seem to count on a person. Color is an intuitive
            experience that helps people find others in complex information. I got some layout advice. I think about
            them when I sketch. Thanks for all the feedback, it was all very useful.
