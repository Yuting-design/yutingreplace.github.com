            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>This project, “Special Day”(name undetermined), is a desktop online sharing platform that aims to inspire
                mutual respect, bring people closer together, and reduce misunderstandings.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p>The goal of the project is to remind people that this day is a special day for certain community members
                and thus promotes mutual respect and understanding. In contrast to similar projects, the special day has
                some unique features. Compared to the calendar of observances, it has more interactivity, not only on
                cultural festivals but also for the content that anyone thinks is important. It pays more attention to
                the day than the Houston and cultural events calendar. It focuses on what is happening right now rather
                than what might happen in the future.</p>

            <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
            <p>The core of the visual design is inclusive, friendly, simple, and colorful. The overall style of the
                project is bright, modern, and fits the screen. Geometric shapes and text are emphasized, but
                photographs or complex decorations are rarely used. Because I want people to focus on the content, not
                the photo. It also helps protect users' personal information. The color changes according to the event
                selected by the user. Positive events are brighter and warmer in color.</p>

            <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
            <p>In this project, users can upload and explain why the day is special for them. First, they need to choose
                an event type, which can be holidays and anniversaries, or special experiences and unexpected rewards.
                The user will be given a card of a different color depending on the selection. After filling in the
                details, the card will be pasted on the display page. Users can also click to view other people's cards
                and comment on them. The page displays all of the content collected that day, including cards and
                comments.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="projectBrief">
            <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
            <p>I hope that people can increase their respect and tolerance for each other by learning about the special
                things that happen in other people's lives. Every day is an ordinary day for some people and an
                extraordinary day for others. Reading other people's stories can bring people together and communities
                together. In order to avoid the negative impact of biased comments and content, I plan to limit user
                input. For example, using API to filter rude and negative words. In this project, it is hoped that happy
                people can share their happiness and sad people can be comforted.</p>
