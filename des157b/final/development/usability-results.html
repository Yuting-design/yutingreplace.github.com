        <section class="projectBrief">
            <h2 class="subtitle">The topic of the project needs more explanation.</h2>
            <p>Although each tester eventually understood the purpose of the project, they all had varying degrees of
                difficulty understanding the content of the project. These include "being distracted by brightly
                coloured squares", "not fully understanding the title of a website" and "misunderstanding the concept of
                a calendar". More guidance and introductions may be needed to quickly understand the topic and purpose
                of the page.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="projectBrief">
            <h2 class="subtitle">The layout still needs to be improved.</h2>
            <p>Testers mostly found the layout and style cute. But they all found similar problems, such as a lack of
                centring of the overall content, a lack of strong associations between names and their corresponding
                content, and a lack of contrast in some areas. There are many layout details that need to be changed.
                These issues don't affect usage, but they make the page look less reliable.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="projectBrief">
            <h2 class="subtitle">The upload part was a success</h2>
            <p>Every tester successfully completed the task of uploading data without hesitation or confusion. Based on
                my subsequent conversations, I found that the upload module conveyed even more information than
                expected. It helps users clarify the purpose of the web page and guides them to enter the right kind of
                information.</p>

        <h1>Plan of update</h1>
        <section class="projectBrief">
            <h2 class="subtitle">
                <ul>
                    <li>Centered body</li>
                    <li>Change the font</li>
                    <li>Added closing popwindow icon</li>
                    <li>Limit transparency</li>
                </ul>
            </h2>
            <p>Based on the feedback, THE changes I plan to make include layout and introductory information. I'll try
                to center the main content. And strengthen headings and introductory paragraphs. I'm thinking of using
                Granim Libiary to make it stand out. Also I noticed that the current font is inappropriate and everyone
                thinks it's a lovely style, so I probably should have used a more appropriate font. During the process
                of observing user uploads, I found that they could not close the window directly, so I decided to add a
                close icon to achieve this goal. In JS, testers have pointed out that some blocks will have a light
                background which gives them a lower contrast. My current solution is two. First, I limit the minimum
                transparency and will no longer decrease when the transparency is less than one number. Second, I check
                the background color and change the font to dark if the color is too light.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to the above modifications, I also made a second plan for myself. This part may not be
                finished before the final, but IF I have extra time I will try to do it.The second phase includes: using
                weather or news apis; Add animation effects; Added "like" functionality for more interaction, added
                "edit" and "delete" functionality.
