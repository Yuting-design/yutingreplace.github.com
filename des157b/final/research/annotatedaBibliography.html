            <p class="summary">This is a video interview. Its theme is cultural prejudice in society. I think it helps
                me understand
                cultural biases in social practice. Psychotherapist Mary Hartwell-Walker, EDD, and Daniel J. Tomasulo,
                PhD,
                talk about cultural biases in society. In the interview, Walker pointed out that people's actions affect
                their thoughts. Reading between the lines of people's language can lead to cultural biases and reinforce
                these impressions. I was inspired by that. Maybe I could add some sentences to my project to remind me
                to
                avoid biased language.</p>

            <p>"9 Fun Themes for Diversity Events: Celebrity Cruises." Celebrity Meetings, Incentives & amp; Charters,
                Celebrity Cruises, 3 Nov. 2020,
                https://www.celebritycorporatekit.com/our-blog/9-fun-themes-for-diversity-events/. </p>
            <p class="summary">This site introduces nine topics available for multicultural activities and explains
                their benefits. This is
                related to my theme, cultural abuse. Cultures need to respect each other. This post is from Celebrity
                Cruises, a company that offers Tours on luxury cruise ships. Celebrity Cruises believes that using
                culture-related food, movies, books, DIY activities and other methods can help customers better
                introduce or
                integrate into a certain culture. I could use some of the suggestions put forward by the site, such as
                prompting users to add special foods or recommended books by a certain date to better introduce their
                own
                culture.</p>

            <p class="summary">This article provides some useful advice and tips on hosting multicultural events and
                eliminating prejudice.
                This is very helpful for my topic, because I also hope that my calendar can help people to eliminate the
                confusion and misunderstanding of different cultures. This is from ADL, an anti-hate group. The group
                has
                been fighting hatred and prejudice in education and the Internet since 1913. The ADL points out that
                campaigns against prejudice should not be biased. Organizers need to take into account the voices of
                more
                people, and it is important to maintain advocacy and involve the community. I agree with the author that
                community is important. So I might decide in my project scope to be in a community rather than a random
                scope. And I need incentives to get more people involved.</p>
