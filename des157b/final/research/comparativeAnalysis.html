            <p>The site reminds users of festivals and anniversaries of various cultures around the world in 2022. It
                lists various anniversaries on display. The picture mainly shows February. The content is great, but I
                think the layout of the page, the selection of images should be more relevant to the date of the event
                content.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://calendar.haatx.com/">HOUSTON'S CULTURAL EVENTS CALENDAR</a></h2>
            <p>This is the calendar the Houston Art Alliance uses for recent events. It shows the different categories
                of activities and notes the dates of the activities. This is similar to my vision for the final project.
                I would probably adopt a similar design. I categorize events by culture or content. </p>
