        <h1>Feasibility Report</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Features</h2>
            <p>My final project, "Today is", shows how each day is special to people by collecting data and
                converting it into visual information. Users can enter and submit why today is a special day. Their
                information will appear on the web page and will be colored according to what is typed. Users can
                view information uploaded by others and see more details by clicking on the title.</p>
            <p>"Today is" includes the ability to display dates, collect data, display data, and information and color
                conversion.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Technologies</h2>
            <h3>Display dates</h3>
            <p>The Display Date function shows the user the date of the day, including word month and numeric date.</p>
            <p>Although I have never tried to capture and display time in other peoject, I do not think it is difficult
                after investigating. I can get the time using <a
                    href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_date.asp">Date()</a> and the <a
                    href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_tolocalestring.asp">ECMAScript Internationalization
                    API</a>. I can then write the data to the document using innerHTML().</p>
            <h3>Collect data</h3>
            <p>Collect Data collects the characters or options uploaded by the user.</p>
            <p>I'll use the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_form.asp">HTML form</a> element to get data and
                then read it in javascript. I don't expect this to be too difficult, as I did this exercise in an
                earlier FrendList assignment.</p>
            <h3>Display data</h3>
            <p>The Display data function displays the uploaded data in an orderly manner on the web page.</p>
            <p>After retrieving data from a table, Display Data writes the data to an HTML file in a specific format to
                Display on the page. It calls the Get Color function to get a color data.Javascript also needs to work
                with CSS to arrange the different "days". This may require the application of grid or Flex Box. I might
                need to use library to arrange the boxes. The optional library is <a
                    href="https://masonry.desandro.com/">Masonry</a>.</p>
            <h3>Information and color conversion</h3>
            <p>In this section, I plan to connect the data uploaded by users with colors. </p>
            <p>There are two options. Plan A: I use the emotion recognition API to distinguish the emotional tendencies
                of the data, and then set different tendencies to different colors. The optional APIs are <a
                    href="https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/sentiment-analysis">Sentiment Analysis API</a> and
                <a href="https://apilayer.com/marketplace/description/text_to_emotion-api#documentation-tab">Text to
                    Emotion API</a>. Plan B: I convert user data directly to color and display it in style. This is
                easier because I've managed to do this with Library Liberty.</p>
