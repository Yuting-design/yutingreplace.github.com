            <h2>Project Brief</h2>
            <h3>Project Summary</h3>
            <p>I chose to improve my Studio 3 as my final project, and I wanted to add more interesting sounds and
                interactions.</p>
            <section>
                <h3>Comparison Project 1</h3>
                <p><a href="http://www.playonlinedicegames.com/blackjack-dice">Blackjack Game</a> is also a game
                    centered on
                    the role of dice. Just like Game of Pig, this game has a number of points. I like the animation when
                    the
                    player makes a decisive action like rolling a die. The designers use graphic dithering to give the
                    player a clue as to who is making the decision. I think it helps to get the player's attention. The
                    layout of the game is also reasonable, and players can easily see which dice will serve which
                    player. I
                    think the design lacks some sound effects. It will be better if you can help with some sounds while
                    shaking. And the interface is too simple, which can get boring. So I think maybe some background
                    graphics should be added.</p>
            </section>

                <h3>Comparison Project 2</h3>
                <p><a href="http://www.playonlinedicegames.com/cacho">Cacho Game</a> is another game centered on the
                    roll of
                    dice. Compared to Blackjack Dice Game, it adds some sound. I like these sounds, which is what I need
                    for
                    my project. The sound of rolling a die makes the game feel more realistic. Another thing I like
                    about it
                    is the delicate background. Since this is a simple two-player game, players don't have to spend a
                    lot of
                    energy playing it. Therefore, rich backgrounds can drain the player's energy while waiting for
                    another
                    player and make the game look more appealing. I think the part that needs improvement is the
                    explanation
                    of the rules. The designer didn't explain the rules of the game well and used a font that was hard
                    to
                    read. I think it's confusing to the player.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Project Goals</h3>
                <p>My goal was to add some user interaction and animation to the original. The similarities with the
                    Blackjack Dice game are that I also use some animation effects, such as scaling the player's image
                    while
                    rolling dice. The difference is that I'm not going to go for a minimalist page. I use fonts that are
                    easier to read than the Cacho game. But I think the sound effects of Cacho Game are worth learning.
                    Beyond that, I use overlays to make players read the rules and celebrate victories. I think overlay
                    can
                    be used properly to increase the interactivity and user experience of a game. So I decided to
                    improve on
                    the overlay parts I dropped in Studio 3 and apply them to the Final Project.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Design Strategies</h3>
                <p>I'm going to keep the overall look of Studio 3, with the cute pink piggy-themed interface. But I will
                    add
                    interactive animations to the original. For example, add a game start screen and a rule description
                    screen. Add some flickering or jumping animations to the images and buttons. Special sound cues are
                    used
                    when the player rolls a point or a snake eye and may be accompanied by a picture. Finally, use an
                    overlay to congratulate the winning player and ask if you want to start the game again. I think this
                    is
                    a great way to increase the game's interactivity and the player's experience.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Interaction Strategies</h3>
                <p>In my plan, the first thing the player will see is a start page made up of a pink pig's head. The
                    player
                    only has the option of returning to the home page and starting the game. After the player chooses to
                    start, there is an overlay that tells the player the rules of the game, and the player has to close
                    the
                    overlay by clicking OK. Then there's the theme of the game. When it's a player's turn to roll a die,
                    the
                    player's corresponding pig will have a unique animation. When the player rolls the snake's eye, the
                    die
                    picture temporarily changes to the snake's head. In the end, there is an overlay to celebrate the
                    player's victory and ask to start a new game.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Experience Goals</h3>
                <p>My goal was to make this simple game fun. First I increased the complexity of the interface with
                    interesting patterns and colors so that the player could absorb more information. Second, I use
                    buttons
                    and overlay to interact with the player. Increase the game's interaction by allowing the player to
                    make
                    choices over and over again. I also used sound to make the game more fun. Third, when players win
                    the
                    game, they get a special celebration page, which is my reward system. As I learned in the Learning
                    Journal, getting a reward makes players want to keep playing a game.</p>
