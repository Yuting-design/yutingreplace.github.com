                <h3>Result 1: The sound of background music is distracting</h3>
                <p>During the three testers, I noticed that the background music was very loud and could not be stopped. Even though the testers didn't point it out, I think the background sound had some bad effects on them. First, turning off sounds is difficult because there is no option to do so. The only thing that can adjust the sound is the sound of the computer. Second, when the background sound stops and starts, it feels sudden. Sudden silence can be confusing to the player. Therefore, I think it is necessary to optimize the background sound. I should add some options to adjust the sound.</p>

                <h3>Result 2: The size of the screen affects the visual effect.</h3>
                <p>Each of the three testers had a screen of different sizes. I noticed that the layout of the page was different on different screens. The overall picture moves down as the screen gets bigger and the position of the buttons shifts. This affects the user experience on a large screen. And the images displayed on the big screen will shrink. I think this is something that needs to be improved. Although the size of the image is in the expected range, the position of the buttons must be adjusted. I want them all to be in a fixed position instead of changing the size of the screen. It is necessary to continue to adjust the layout on the different screens.

                <h3>Result 3: The success of the picture</h3>
                <p>All the testers thought the pictures I drew were great. They are fun and help the player understand the game. I think that's good. The feedback I got was that I wanted to animate them. I think it's a great idea. I wanted to add a dynamic effect to remind the player to start the game or switch player, and it would also make the game more interesting. I think the strategy is to remind the player of the order in which to roll the dice by shaking the picture or changing different pictures. I will further test the specific scheme.
